-Aldo Leopold, A Sand County Almanac

I am an ecosystem scientist and writer whose work focuses on illuminating the tangled web of relationships between plants, microbes, soils, and the environment.

Currently, I am a postdoctoral scholar at the University of Montana with [Cory Cleveland](https://www.cfc.umt.edu/research/biogeochemistry/), where I help lead the [INCyTE Research Coordination Network](https://www.cfc.umt.edu/research/incyte/default.php). INCyTE is an NSF-funded research coordination network focusing on improving Earth system models (aka how we predict future climate change!) by more accurately representing the cycling of nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus.

I also love to write (sometimes about science)! In summer 2020, I had the amazing opportunity to sharpen my communication skills as a science reporter at The Wichita Eagle, in Wichita KS, through the AAAS Mass Media Fellowship.

Previously, I worked with [Kate Scow](http://scowlab.lawr.ucdavis.edu/) (UC Davis) and [Debbie Bossio](https://www.nature.org/en-us/about-us/who-we-are/our-people/deborah-bossio/) (The Nature Conservancy) to better characterize how soil biology and management affect carbon sequestration. I completed my Ph.D. in Soils & Biogeochemistry in 2018 at UC Davis in [Ben Houlton's](https://www.bzhoulton.com) lab. My dissertation research focused on a variety of plant-soil-microbe interactions in the terrestrial nitrogen cycle.

I am passionate about equity in both STEM fields and outdoor spaces – two places I spend a lot of time in as a field-based scientist. In 2017, I worked with a group of graduate students, undergraduate students, and staff at UC Davis to found [Girls’ Outdoor Adventure in Leadership and Science (GOALS)](https://girlsoutdoorscience.com/), a free field-based science and leadership education program for high school girls, gender-expansive, and non-binary youth identifying with girlhood. 

My goal as a scientist and writer is to share the sheer joy of asking such questions and understanding the world around us a little bit better, and to make those opportunities more inclusive and accessible for all. For me, scientific exploration is one of the most fascinating and exciting ways to interact and connect with the natural world, and I hope to promote understanding and connecting with nature as a pathway to developing deeper empathy for the planet, other human beings, and ourselves.
