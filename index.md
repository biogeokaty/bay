I am a Research Soil Scientist at the USDA-NRCS National Soil Survey Center and work based out of my home in northwest Vermont. My research focuses on illuminating the biophysical mechanisms of soil carbon storage in diverse landscapes, and developing tools and metrics to support land management that promotes soil ecosystem function and carbon sequestration.
